# Introduction
“Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.” — Bill Gates

In this report, I analyzed nearly 2 million reviews by listeners of over 100,000 podcasts. Using sentiment analysis and inferential statistics, I hoped to arrive at insights that could potentially be useful to current and future podcast creators.

# Goal
To provide usable information for creating good podcasts or improving the quality of existing ones.

# Datasets
I used 3 databases from Kaggle's Mental Health in the Tech Industry and concentrated on tech industry workers who work for tech companies:

# Conclusions
**Number of Reviews in this Analysis:** I analyzed over 1 million reviews of about 100,000 podcasts.  <br>
**The Sentiments of Podcast Listeners:** This analysis showed that 92% of reviewers were those who rated the podcast with 4 or 5 stars. This fact makes the results of this analysis highly suspect and I can not come to a sure conclusion about the general sentiments of the podcast listener population. What about those who did not write any reviews? Were they satisfied, or dissatisfied? <br>
**Recommendations for Podcast Creators:** I set the ambitious goal of being able to tell the current and future podcast creators what they can do better to create more appealing podcasts. I am sorry to report that I did not achieve this goal. By this analysis, I can not form any definitive recommendations for podcast creators on how to improve their podcasts or how to create a popular one.
